## Research Equity and Inclusion

Please note that the University of Waterloo has a strong commitment to increasing equity, diversity, inclusion, and supporting Indigenous initiatives (EDII) in all facets of its operations and to remove barriers to achieving an equitable academic, research and campus environment. This commitment is rooted in one of Waterloo’s core values - we all belong. In our pursuit of excellence, we create conditions for everyone to flourish.
